This Lab assignment was to create an ALU capable of 7 arithmentic and logic operations shown in the image above.

ALU.v is the top level module.
NbitAdder.v is a dynamically generated 32bit adder.
FullAdder.v is the 1 bit full adder module used to instantiate the NbitAdder.
ALU_TB.v is the Modelsim Testbench.

The two images are simulation screenshots.
