This Lab assignment was to create an ALU capable of 7 arithmentic and logic operations shown in the image above.

ALU.v is the top level module.\n
NbitAdder.v is a dynamically generated 32bit adder\n
FullAdder.v is the 1 bit full adder module used to instantiate the NbitAdder\n
ALU.v is the Modelsim Testbench.\n\n

The two images are simulation screenshots.
